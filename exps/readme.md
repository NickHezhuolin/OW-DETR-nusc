My sincere apologies for the delay in posting the weights link. 
[Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QoDBZTAFyNDQAeGGEC2zkbn-_Q9ij36Y?usp=sharing) contains weights for both OWOD splits and our proposed splits.
Please download the weights from this folder and keep them in exps/ folder in the home directory of the project. Please do let me know if any issues occur.
